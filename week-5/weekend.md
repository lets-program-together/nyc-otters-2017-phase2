## Weekend

### Core

**Challenges**

- Complete [Sinatra AJAX Self-Assessment](../../../../ajax-checkpoint-challenge) in 2 hours
(maximum!). When you've completed the challenge, submit a pull request.

### Review

**Challenges - OOJS** (Object Oriented JavaScript)

- Read [Intro to OOJS](../resources/alycit_e6f5f20ced9b42a64f5a.md)
- [Live Code - OOJS - Kevin](https://talks.devbootcamp.com/oojs-zoo-example)

**Challenges - AJAX**

Continue practicing and slowly working to demystify asynchronous requests and DOM manipulation. It's easy to want to copy and paste your setup from another challenge, but try first to pull from your memory. Try things in the console and don't resist using `console.log()` and `debugger` to help understand the state of your code.

- [AJAX your CRUD apps](../../../../ajax-review-challenge)

**Challenges - CRUD**

Practicing CRUD is highly suggested this weekend. How you do that is completely up to you. I've included the below challenges for you if you don't have another personal CRUD app you want to build.

- [Todo List](../../../../ToDoList)
- [Hacker News Clone Part One](../../../../hacker-news-clone-part-1-challenge)
- [Hacker News Clone Part Two](../../../../hacker-news-clone-part-2-challenge)

**Challenges - ActiveRecord Associations**

If you need more practice with AR Associations, complete the shirts challenge. It is definitely challenging, but it will help prepare you immensely for the assessment, phase three, and the rest of your career.
